<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Below are some options to try for specific issues.

### RVM Is Producing Errors or Warnings

1. Close your terminal, reopen it, and try the `rvm list` command.

2. If you see a warning regarding the `PATH`, try running the following
   first:

   ```sh
   rvm use 2.6.1
   rvm --default use 2.6.1
   ```

   Close and reopen the terminal again, and rerun `rvm list`.

3. If RVM is not found when you run `rvm list`, try reinstalling RVM:

    ```sh
    curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby --auto-dotfiles
    ```

    You may get an error regarding keys with further
    commands to try, including the following:

    ```sh
    gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB

    or if it fails:

    command curl -sSL https://rvm.io/mpapis.asc | gpg --import -
    command curl -sSL https://rvm.io/pkuczynski.asc | gpg --import -
    ```

   Try each of these, followed by the previous `curl` command to install RVM.

4. If RVM is found but continues to produce errors, try uninstalling with:

   ```sh
   rvm implode
   ```

   This will remove RVM entirely. Follow the instructions in Step 3 to reinstall RVM.

### `learn whoami` Command Not Found / `learn` Produces `oj.bundle` Error

1. Close your terminal window, reopen it, and try the `learn whoami` command
   again.

2. Run the command `rvm list`. If RVM is not found, follow the steps in the
   previous troubleshooting section on installing RVM. If you see a warning
   regarding `PATH`, try running the following first:

   ```sh
   rvm use 2.6.1
   rvm --default use 2.6.1
   ```

   Then reinstall the Learn gem and test it again with:

   ```sh
   gem install learn-co
   learn whoami
   ```

3. If the `learn` command continues to fail, but RVM is working fine, try
   reinstalling RVM by first using the following command:

   ```sh
   rvm implode
   ```

   Then rerunning the RVM install script:

   ```sh
   curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby --auto-dotfiles
   ```

   Once RVM is installed, try reinstalling and testing the `learn-co` gem.

4. If you are still unable to run `learn whoami`, try the following:

   ```sh
   bundle clean --force
   gem install learn-co
   gem install bundler
   ```

   This will clear out any gems that have already been installed. At the moment,
   you will only need the `learn-co` and `bundler` gems, so this reinstalls
   them.

### `learn` Commands Produce `psych` Gem Errors

This error is typically due to issues in the `~/.learn-config` file. 

1.  Run `code ~/.learn-config`. This file should only have three lines in it, 
    similar to the example below:

    ```sh
    ---
    :learn_directory: "/Users/< username >/Flatiron/code"
    :editor: code
    ```

2.  Check for any typos or extra content. Make sure the `:learn_directory` path
    is valid and has your computer's username after `/Users/`. You can confirm this
    name by running `echo $HOME`. 

3.  Save the `.learn-config` file and try running `learn whoami`.  -->
